Hello World!
John McDonald
	I am enjoying this assignment so much I might have to just do it again when I finish! ;) 
	Software Development and Design is already one of my favorite MIS classes. I enjoy how we
	are already getting into the software side of things with hands on assignments. Professor
	Colbert is a great teacher! I am in two of his classes this semester and I really enjoy his 
	teaching style.
